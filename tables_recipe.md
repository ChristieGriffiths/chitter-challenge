# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here the final line).


As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter
```

```
Nouns:

username, email_address, peep, time_of_peep
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| user                  | username, email_address
| post                  | peep, time_of_peep

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `users` 

    Column names: `username`, `email_address`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `posts` 

    Column names: `peep`, `time_of_peep`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: users
id: SERIAL
username: text
email_address: text

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
peep: text
time_of_peep: timestamp [ (p) ] [ without time zone ]
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one user have many peeps? Yes
2. Can one peep have many users? No

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **User has many Peeps**
2. And on the other side, **Peeps belongs to users**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]

Replace the relevant bits in this example with your own:

```

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: albums_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE artists (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username: text,
  email_address: text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE albums (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  peep text,
  time_of_peep timestamp [ (p) ] [ without time zone ],
  user_id int,
  constraint fk_user foreign key(user_id)
    references users(id)
    on delete cascade
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
